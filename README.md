# sentinel
Inszoom hackathon

Sentinel is a calender mailny reminder app.

Built on The famous language PHP and its mate mysql
 along with Javascript with its friend Backbonejs
 css and its friend sass and their neighbour python the whole app.
 Has a intuitive design and altough riddled wit some bugs works great if spent some time on.


In search of sms api providers we found pvlio eventhough twilio is great we couldnot move through its hurdles ... great one .. gotta try... they let us use few free msgs...
In the launch.py file submit your detials and you will rock.

The Initial idea was to use cron jobs and keep on and on running scripts but at this particular situation we thought of building only for one person and no boring login/signup system again.

So the scripts just checks if any about the end reminders and alerts the users.
Eventhough pvlio provided php apis we had ssl certificate erros at the time and we used python api.

The strong support by backbonejs and sass made us build the design fast and healty.
Everything is built form scratch.
Usign the recent technology WEB notifications which helps users receive notifications even though they are on other sites. we have made extreme use of the tech.

Providing sms and web notifications along with a timeline of daily work and reminders will be the main thme of this tool.

Thank you,
Hope you remember Sentinel prime from Transformers.
